## Overview

"Bound by Shadows" is an original anime production project designed for solo creators using AI tools. This repository contains all planning documents, character designs, storyboards, and production guidelines needed to create a 12-episode anime series featuring two overpowered protagonists with a unique art and music-based power system.

## Project Description

In a world where "The Fracture" tore open the barrier between dimensions, two powerful individuals with tragic pasts discover their destinies are intertwined. Rei Kageyama, the Composer, manipulates time through music, while Kai Shirogane, the Artist, shapes reality through art. Together, they stand against corruption and hatred, forming an unbreakable bond that transcends their broken pasts.

The series explores themes of unwavering loyalty, the rejection of intolerance, and finding strength through connection, all visualized through a unique power system based on the concept that "Art is the way we decorate space, and music is the way we decorate time."

## Key Features

- **Dual Protagonist Story:** Features two overpowered main characters with complementary abilities
- **Unique Power System:** Art-based spatial powers and music-based temporal powers
- **Complete Production Plan:** 24-week schedule for solo anime creation
- **AI Tool Integration:** Specific workflows for ChatGPT 4o image generation and Pika animation
- **Comprehensive Storyboards:** Detailed visual planning for key scenes
- **Google Cloud and Firebase Integration:**
This project plans to utilize Google Cloud services and Firebase to support its development and potential deployment. Firebase will be employed for data storage, ensuring data integrity, and enabling user management features if needed. Google Cloud services will be considered for potentially serving AI models, which could enhance various aspects of the production pipeline, such as content generation or optimization. These services are chosen for their scalability, reliability, and ability to grow with the project's needs, from initial development to possible expansion.

-**Browser Compatibility:**

Given the project's reliance on AI tools for various creative tasks, ensuring browser compatibility is crucial. Throughout the development process, testing will be performed across major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. If compatibility issues arise with specific AI tool outputs or functionalities, fallback solutions or alternative AI tool choices will be considered to maintain a consistent and accessible experience.



- **Soundtrack Guidance:** Music design that reinforces the art/music power theme

## Audio Production

While the actual audio production (voice acting, sound effects implementation, and final mixing) is outside the immediate scope of this AI-focused solo project, this repository is set up to plan for its eventual integration. This planning will include:

- **Voice Acting Placeholders:** Identifying where dialogue and character voices are needed.
- **Sound Effect Planning:** Determining the types of sound effects required for key scenes and actions.
- **Music Placement:** Defining where music tracks should start, stop, and transition to enhance the narrative.

The `soundtrack/soundtrack_guidance.md` file will be essential in guiding the final audio production, ensuring that music and sound design reinforce the art/music power theme.



## Getting Started

1. Review the comprehensive production guide in `final_document/bound_by_shadows_production_guide.md`
2. Familiarize yourself with the character profiles and enhanced abilities
3. Study the AI tool workflows for image generation and animation
4. Follow the production schedule for a structured approach to development

## AI Tools Used

- **Character Design:** ChatGPT 4o Image Generation
- **Background/Environment Design:** ChatGPT 4o Image Generation
- **Animation:** Pika AI
- **Music Generation:** AI music tools (with provided prompts)

## Production Timeline

The complete anime production is structured as a 24-week project:
- **Weeks 1-4:** Pre-production (concept finalization, character design, world design, storyboarding)
- **Weeks 5-20:** Production (episode creation, mid-production review)
- **Weeks 21-24:** Post-production (final editing, audio planning, package preparation)
