## Storyboard Guidelines for AI Image Generation

### Character Consistency
- Maintain consistent character designs across all scenes
- Ensure mark designs remain accurate and glow appropriately during power use
- Character expressions should reflect their emotional states and development

### Power Visualization
- Rei's powers should always incorporate musical elements (notation, waves, measures)
- Kai's powers should always incorporate artistic elements (brushstrokes, colors, perspectives)
- Combined powers should show clear visual blending of both styles
- Power effects should escalate in visual complexity as the series progresses

### Environmental Design
- Environments should reflect the emotional tone of scenes
- Order facilities should feel sterile, oppressive, and coldly efficient
- Wraith-infested areas should show environmental corruption and decay
- Safe havens should feel warm and harmonious despite hidden dangers

### Action Sequence Framing
- Dynamic camera angles that emphasize power effects
- Clear visual progression of cause and effect in combat
- Moments of power synchronization should be framed for maximum impact
- Contrast between chaotic battle environments and focused character actions

### Emotional Impact Scenes
- Use close-ups for emotional revelations
- Employ color shifts to reflect emotional changes
- Create visual parallels between past traumas and present strengths
- Frame moments of connection between Rei and Kai to emphasize their growing bond

## AI Image Generation Approach

1. **Generate key character poses** for main emotional and action moments
2. **Create environment concept art** for major settings
3. **Develop power effect style guides** showing progression of abilities
4. **Produce storyboard panels** for critical sequences
5. **Design transition frames** for animation reference

Each image should include detailed notes on:
- Camera angle and framing
- Lighting and color direction
- Character positioning and expression
- Power effect visualization
- Environmental response
- Emotional tone to convey
